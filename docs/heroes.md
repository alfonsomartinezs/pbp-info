# The Heroes


## The Cleric

My God is Ampharos, the God of thunderstorms, lightning, and flocks of sheep. I was raised as a shepherd in the mountain valley village of Ingenstans. They are well known as the lesser of lesser gods among the patheons but to mountain valley villages they are one of the main deities since praying to Ampharos seems to usually work. Village was doing well, I was even to be married but while doing my normal herding I lost a flock to the earth as the ground opened up and closed abruptly after they all fell in. I searched for hours until it was too dark to go back safely. 

Stranded I closed my eyes, knelt, and prayed for the flock and I prayed to survive the night. Lightning struck nearby tossing me like a dirty rag. In the small crater left behind I found a rams horn fashioned into a musical horn. I blew the horn as loud as i could and passed out unexpectedly. When I awoke it was day and the horn was nowhere to be found. All around me lay dead goblins, seemingly prepared to slay me moments before i blew the horn. I walked back to the village to meet up with my flock halfway looking shaken but well. 

I later found out that Ampharos had seen the attack coming and hid my sheep, leaving me the choice to go back home empty handed or to put my trust in Ampharos that all would be well and become a true servant of the Lightning Sheep God. She seems pretty chill so far but has hinted that my destiny is not here but elsewhere. I decided to postpone my marriage after a pilgrimage to spread the love of Ampharos to other small villages in an attempt to lift the God higher on the patheon.



## The Immolator

Immolators are not born, they are made. A monster broke the village crystal and was carrying off children. A travelling Immolator defeated the monster and instead of asking for payment, he said we must sacrifice something precious of the village. Being the last child alive in the village, I was offered. The Immolator led me to a hidden valley called the Pyre. There I was led into the miasma and subjected to the cleansing fires. I came out changed.

Immolators solve problems and hunt monsters. They are treated much like Witchers, they are needed but feared.


## The Keeper

Member of an order of peace keepers, commonly referred to "keepers". They have historically been given authority to keep the peace across the land. The order picks its own members, often times from pre-adulthood. Its authority mostly lies in historically having that authority - ruling bodies continue that lease because they don't have a reason not to.


## The Loremaster

Area of expertise is histories of  bygone civilizations and peoples, gained mostly through swapping stories in roadside inns & remote villages and finding any common threads throughout them that point towards the truth. Novels, journals, and tomes of the history of that era are a welcome but rare find. 

## The Slayer

>My honor is my life and without it I am nothing. I shall become a Slayer. I shall seek redemption in the eyes of my ancestors. I shall become as death to my enemies, until I face he that takes my life and my shame. I have made a pilgrimage to the holy Shrine of Grimnir and I have cut my name upon the pillar, where the names of many other Slayers have been carved over the millennium. Thus I take The Slayer's Oath.

>Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!
