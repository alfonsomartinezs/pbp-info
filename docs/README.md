# Welcome to The Continent.

The Continent is a precious, dangerous place. This is where you were born -- where all of your people were born, nurtured and destroy by the forces that bind you to the land. 

Think of the Continent as a precious treasure, beautiful and coveted by existence itself. The forces of existence pull at the land and the people on it like greedy hands hoping to wrench it from the rest. 

Against this cosmic background, the Continent has recently ended a long war. The world rests, but old wounds still fester. The Capitol and its Judges still feuds with the Great Houses, who in turn feud with the Keepers and Immolators. The people suffer. Discontent grows, and there are murmers of dark paths to power available to any who would follow.

The World you know is split into 4 major areas:
- **The Valley** spreads from the center of the land to its southern coast. The mists travel across the land closer to the edge, but the capitol at the center lays mostly undisturbed. The *Seats* of the Capitol have their home here, one of the last settlements where they don't fight betterly with the *Large Houses* for control.
- **The Mistlands**, to the north of the valley. The land within is covered in mist more often than not, so the denizens rely on mountaintops for safety and on the tunnels and shardscape for travel. **Judges** and **Keepers** visit freely, and immolators are generally more tolerated than in other areas. 
- **The Silver Coast** to the east of the valley. Separated from the capitol by mountain ranges, settlements on the silver coast heed the *Seats* and their *Judges* with varying degrees of apathy. The *Large Houses* rule here, but rumors spread of a mysterious *cult* that promises freedom even from them. Paveido is the largest city on the silver coast, and functions as a home for members of the Houses.
- **Curesh** is a forest to the west of the valley, protected from the mists by a group known as the Council. Though all are welcome to visit, only few select to stay. The forest has dangers of its own, distinct from the rest of the land. While not actively hostile, the council of elves dislikes *immolators*.

### Starting the Adventure
Your party finds itself under the earth, escorting travellers of all sorts to [Haven](haven.md). It's been several weeks and many travellers have been lost, but the city is only days away.

## World Truths

The forces fighting for the Continent have had some major effects on the land, as have the people's responses to them.

### Binding Oaths

Oaths are expected to be honored upon the life of the swearer, and with guest right a person can expect to be shown hospitality even in the homes of their fiercest enemies. When these ancient laws of the land are disobeyed, the resulting punishment can forever change the life of the person. 

Oaths and curses are not enforced by any particular god. These are natural laws that were woven into the fabric of the land at the dawn of time. Even Gods must honor their oaths or suffer dreadful consequences.


### The Wraith Mists

Parts of the world are covered in a thick miasma that must be fought back with magic. Some that are exposed are forever changed, seen as a miracle that they are still alive. Others die. The worst fate is when victims are taken and turned into unrecognizable monsters by the billowing fog.


### A Hollow World with Deep Roots

The world is hollow with tunnels and caverns. This 'underdark' seems to have a mind or will of its own. Entrances appear and close seemingly randomly... Some last multiple lifetimes, others only days. The tunnels below ground shift and migrate on their own. Civilizations with roots thousands of years old, and the large caverns they dominate, appear and disappear.

Due to large portions of the world being covered in impassible arcane (?) miasma and the crystal network being imperfect, underground explorers are always in demand to connect new 'crystal nodes' or transport valuable cargo too large for 'crystal travel' Saying crystal so much gave me final fantasy flashbacks.

### Erratic Weather

The miasma and the magics used to fight it have wrecked havoc on the weather. It may be a sunny day today, a blizzard tomorrow, and sweltering heat the day after

### A Connected World

Travel has been simplified by crystals. Almost everyone has a hearthstone or use the public major crystals at town centers to go from place to place. Seems to not work well enough for commerce though.

### Great Houses

Commerce and finance are largely controlled by large national and international banking houses. These houses are generally family-run, and their heads hold major political sway, due to the fact that heads of state usually have to go to them for financing projects, wars, etc. Many of these houses are given permission to strike their own currency & field armies of mercenaries. The 4 largest houses operate a cartel on transport crystal production, from which they derive much of their wealth.

### A Cult on the Rise

An underground (literally or not) movement has started to cause stirs in the people across the realm/continent/land that the path to personal power lies with the ritual sacrifice of living beings. This cult is not yet so commonplace that everyone knows about it, but rumors are starting to circulate.

### A Growing Flame in the Night Sky

A star in the night's sky grows brighter by the month. Some scholars speculate it is a meteor of cataclysmic proportions, others say it is the final stage of a prophecy set in motion hundreds of years ago. While the people as a whole cannot agree with what it means, a number of children across the land have had strange, uniform dreams involving an eye made of ice watching them from the sky.
