# Welcome to The Continent.


## The Wraith Mists

Parts of the world are covered in a thick miasma that must be fought back with magic. Some that are exposed are forever changed, seen as a miracle that they are still alive. Others die. The worst fate is when victims are taken and turned into unrecognizable monsters by the billowing fog.


## A Hollow World with Deep Roots

The world is hollow with tunnels and caverns. This 'underdark' seems to have a mind or will of its own. Entrances appear and close seemingly randomly... Some last multiple lifetimes, others only days. The tunnels below ground shift and migrate on their own. Civilizations with roots thousands of years old, and the large caverns they dominate, appear and disappear.

Due to large portions of the world being covered in impassible arcane (?) miasma and the crystal network being imperfect, underground explorers are always in demand to connect new 'crystal nodes' or transport valuable cargo too large for 'crystal travel' Saying crystal so much gave me final fantasy flashbacks.

## Erratic Weather

The miasma and the magics used to fight it have wrecked havoc on the weather. It may be a sunny day today, a blizzard tomorrow, and sweltering heat the day after

## A Connected World

Travel has been simplified by crystals. Almost everyone has a hearthstone or use the public major crystals at town centers to go from place to place. Seems to not work well enough for commerce though.

## Great Houses

Commerce and finance are largely controlled by large national and international banking houses. These houses are generally family-run, and their heads hold major political sway, due to the fact that heads of state usually have to go to them for financing projects, wars, etc. Many of these houses are given permission to strike their own currency & field armies of mercenaries. The 4 largest houses operate a cartel on transport crystal production, from which they derive much of their wealth.

## The Cult of the Scale

An underground (literally or not) movement has started to cause stirs in the people across the realm/continent/land that the path to personal power lies with the ritual sacrifice of living beings. This cult is not yet so commonplace that everyone knows about it, but rumors are starting to circulate.
