## Break an Oath

When you break an oath, **roll +nothing**. On a 10+ choose 2, on a 7-9 choose 1:
- The Sign of the Oathbreaker does not mark your body and soul.
- Food does not turn to sand in your mouth.
- You are not visited by the Eyeless.

These conditions persist until you remedy or fulfill the oath, or you are released from it. If you are an adult and die while these conditions persist, you will rise as a fleshless.
