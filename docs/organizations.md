## Seats of Judgement

Each settlement has an elected judge who interprets the various laws and makes rulings on the various conflicts within their domain. In addition, the Capitol has a certain number of travelling judges, authorities in whichever settlement they're currently residing in. These judges are elected by the capitol citizens. 


## The Keepers

An order of peace keepers, commonly referred to "keepers", have historically been given authority to keep the peace across the land. A keeper would be supported by the local authorities (or a broader body) should they strike down a murderer on a spree or capturing a suspect for the region's guards, but not inasmuch as administering an execution for a suspected murderer. The order picks its own members, often times from pre-adulthood. 

Its authority mostly lies in historically having that authority - ruling bodies continue that lease because they don't have a reason not to.

## The Immolators

Immolators are not born, they are made.

Immolators solve problems and hunt monsters. They are needed, but feared.


## The Great Houses

Commerce and finance are largely controlled by large national and international banking houses. These houses are generally family-run, and their heads hold major political sway, due to the fact that heads of state usually have to go to them for financing projects, wars, etc. Many of these houses are given permission to strike their own currency & field armies of mercenaries. 

The 4 largest houses operate a cartel on transport crystal production, from which they derive much of their wealth.
