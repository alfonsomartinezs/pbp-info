# The Mistlands

## Haven

Haven is a middling city, surrounded by mists in all directions but filled to the brim with [Shards](/?id=a-connected-world) connected to most major cities, including the Capitol.

### Ill-Gotten Gains

The only honest pub in Haven, run by [One-Tooth](npcs?id=one-tooth) and his brothers. 

The loremaster has a semi-permanent room there at a discounted rate; Their stories are good for business.



## The Brink

A cliffside perch overlooking a valley of miasma that houses a shrine to a near-irrelevant minor deity. It's estimated that in a few months, the miasma will shift and flood the area.
